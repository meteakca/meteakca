##### The Process (for me)

* Develop curiosity
* Gather background
* Design the study

- - -

##### Curiosity (sources)

* Previous (failed) attempts
* Collaborations

- - -

##### Creating the writing space

* Gather background and shape up the initial draft
* Make a good outline!
* Fill out the outline with notes from readings
* Mark (color code) the calendar to book out reading/writing times

- - -

##### Collaborations

* Seek out colleagues to help
* Be specific with what you ask of them
* Be available to join other projects

  * At a given time, I am usually involved in 5-10 projects at various levels
  * Not all will stick, that's ok (time is precious)

- - -

##### Finding the time

* Using calendars effectively
* Making time to read (or listen)!

- - -

##### Finding new fuel

* Open to learning new things (methods, concepts, theories)
* New methods (for data collection & analysis) means new ways to look at things
* Twitter (e.g., r \[studio] community)
* Burn outs...normal...stay calm
