### Why game design?

* Game design is fun and engaging/appealing for students (and teachers)
* It (can) target cognitive and motivational outcomes
* It can lead to future jobs

### Why game design with Unity?
{{< figure src="u_logo_black_rgb.png" height="180px" width="180px" >}}

* Unity is an industry-standard software
* It is uses C# + and a Game-Development Engine
* Is a direct connection to real-life game development
* Block-based coding has limits

#### Project GAME

* Followed GDL (Akcaoglu, 2016)'s structure:

  * Cognitive Goals
  * Structured around Games as Units
  * From simple to complex
  * Repetition
* ARCS (Attention, Relevance, Confidence, Satisfaction)

- - -

#### Project GAME

* Year 1: Teacher Professional Development (Online)
* Year 2 (this year): Pilot + Implementation

- - -

#### What works:

* {{< hl >}}Designers (Research Team  & Teachers) {{< /hl >}}go through the process as learners
* Flow (Simple Games --> More complex games)

  * Simple games: quick achievements + easier to grasp concepts
  * Complex games: more fun + repetition of older concepts and new concepts

- - -

#### How to adopt and what to pay attention to:

* Project GAME Website (last slide)
* Follow key principles

  * Simple to complex
  * Games first
  * Go through the design as learners
  * Flexible curriculum
