#### Project GAME

* Year 1: Teacher Professional Development

  * Online 
  * Summer institute (f2f, 4 days)
* Year 2 (this year): Pilot + Implementation

#### What works:

* {{< hl >}}Designers (Research Team  & Teachers) {{< /hl >}}go through the process as learners
* Flow (Simple Games --> More complex games)

  * Simple games: quick achievements + easier to grasp concepts
  * Complex games: more fun + repetition of older concepts and new concepts

#### How to adopt and what to pay attention to:

* Project GAME Website (last slide)
* Follow key principles

  * Simple to complex
  * Games first
  * Go through the design as learners
  * Flexible curriculum
