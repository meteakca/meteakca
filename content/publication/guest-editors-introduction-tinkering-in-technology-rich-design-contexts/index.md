  Tinkering is an iterative problem-solving process (Bevan, Gutwill, Petrich, &
  Wilkinson, 2015; Martinez & Stager, 2013; Resnick & Rosenbaum, 2013). It is
  interest driven, usually informal, and often playful. At the heart of
  tinkering is the will and skill to be able to design successful systems, and
  solve problems. Tinkering is central to making, and can be facilitated through
  technology-rich (eg, 3D printers, robotics kits, coding software, etc.) and
  non-technological tools (eg, plastic cups, rubber bands, papers, etc.) by
  allowing learners to be the designers and makers of objects, projects, or
  ideas (Resnick, 2017).

  Following the footsteps of Papert’s constructionism (1980), makerspaces, STEM or STEAM labs, or studios are increasingly finding a place in formal school settings (Becker et al., 2017). While there is a lack of visibility of these efforts to guide, unify, and possibly help replicate future practice and research, various …
