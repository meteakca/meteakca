abstract: Computer programming is becoming an essential skill for young students
  regardless of their education or career goals. Therefore, for students to
  develop and for educators and researchers to accurately measure self-efficacy
  in and value for programming is important. Although student motivation in
  subject matter can be measured using self-report surveys, these types of
  instruments are prone to error due to inherent biases. In this
  quasi-experimental and cross-sectional study, we examined whether using a
  computer programming pretest before taking a perception survey (i.e.,
  providing examples of the key concept in the survey beforehand) had an impact
  on students’ self-reported self-efficacy and utility value, thus helping
  collect more accurate data. Results showed no significant difference on
  self-efficacy and value scores between those who received a pretest and those
  who did not. In further analysis, however, it was found that pretest
  performance was positively correlated with self-efficacy and value. In
  addition, boys reported significantly higher self-efficacy and value than
  girls, confirming gender disparity outlined in previous research. An
  exploratory, but important, finding was that there was an interaction between
  gender and test performance for the self-efficacy and utility value. While
  boys’ who had high pretest scores also reported higher levels of self-efficacy
  and utility value, it was the opposite for girls.
