abstract: The Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, and Redefinition (SAMR)
  model is a four-level, taxonomy-based approach for selecting, using, and
  evaluating technology in K-12 settings (Puentedura 2006). Despite its
  increasing popularity among practitioners, the SAMR model is not currently
  represented in the extant literature. To focus the ongoing conversation
  regarding K-12 educators’ understanding and implementation of technology, we
  provide a critical review of the SAMR model using theory and prior research.
  We focus on the absence of context, its hierarchical structure, and the
  emphasis placed on product over process and conclude with suggestions to guide
  educators’ and researchers’ technology integration efforts.
