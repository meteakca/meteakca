abstract: The purpose of this research study was twofold. First, we sought to
  refine a rubric originally created to assess the pre-service teachers' TPACK.
  Second and in doing the first, we sought to assess lesson plans created by
  leading technology companies (HP, Intel, and Microsoft) to both see how much
  these companies were mindful about purposeful and effective usage of
  technology in teaching. The refinements to the rubric, the awareness of the
  technology companies on effective technology integration and future directions
  to be taken to further refine and validate the rubric are discussed.
