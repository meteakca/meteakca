abstract: Technology is rapidly becoming a predominant force for education, and
  teachers now more than ever have nearly endless technological tools at their
  disposal. The specific role of technology in education is not always well
  understood or utilized to its full potential (Cuban, Kirkpatrick, & Peck,
  2001). The Technology Pedagogy Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework attempts to
  elaborate on the 3 essential types of knowledge required by teachers for
  successful technology integration (Mishra & Koehler, 2006; Koehler & Mishra,
  2008; 2009). The TPACK framework also attempts to illustrate the dynamic and
  interconnected nature of the three primary components; technology knowledge,
  pedagogy knowledge, and content knowledge. In this paper, we propose a
  complementary method of analysis to identify practical and applied elements of
  TPACK in pre-service teacher lesson plans. We propose this lesson-plan coding
  scheme not as a replacement for the TPACK survey but rather as a supplement.
