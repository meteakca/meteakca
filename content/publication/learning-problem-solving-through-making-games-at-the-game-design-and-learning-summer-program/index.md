abstract: Today’s complex and fast-evolving world necessitates young students to
  possess design and problem-solving skills more than ever. One alternative
  method of teaching children problem-solving or thinking skills has been using
  computer programming, and more recently, game-design tasks. In this
  pre-experimental study, a group of middle school students (n = 18) with an age
  average of 12.6 attended a game-design summer program for 10 days. Students
  were assessed in their problem-solving skills, specifically in system analysis
  and design, decision-making, and troubleshooting domains, at the beginning and
  end of the program. The results indicated that there were significant
  improvements in students’ problem-solving skills after attending the summer
  program, Wilks’ Λ = .258, F (3, 15) = 14.397, p < .001, η 2 = .742. For system
  analysis and design, and decision-making follow-up t-tests pointed to large
  and medium effect sizes, while for troubleshooting the gains were not
  significant. This study is a contributes to the growing body of literature
  investigating the benefits of designing games for young children by adding
  that game-design activities can be suitable venues for young children to learn
  and practice problem-solving skills.
