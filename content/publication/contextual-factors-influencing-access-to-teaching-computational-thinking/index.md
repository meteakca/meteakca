abstract: This study attempts to determine whether teachers' access to
  computational thinking (CT) and CT technologies varies by rurality (rural
  versus urban) of the school county and grade level taught (primary versus
  secondary). A total of 81 teachers from West Virginia, Georgia, and Oklahoma
  participated in this survey study. Overall, teachers found CT and CT tools
  useful and relevant to their teaching and had access to an essential level of
  technology in schools supporting computational thinking. However, teachers' CT
  skills and their teaching of CT were limited and varied depending on rurality
  and grade level. For instance, primary school teachers in rural settings
  reported significantly lower levels of CT skills than those in urban settings.
  Findings and implications are discussed.
