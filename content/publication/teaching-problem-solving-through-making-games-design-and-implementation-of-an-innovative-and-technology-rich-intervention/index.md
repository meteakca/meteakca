abstract: In this paper, I describe the elements of a curriculum designed to
  teach middle school students how to solve complex problems using digital
  game-design as the main activity. Based on theories of problem solving and
  teaching of problem solving, and harnessing the affordances of digital
  game-design (ie, engagement) the created problem-solving curriculum
  incorporated activities that gave students hands-on experiences with both
  design, and problem-solving at the same time. While there are many similar
  efforts, what separates this initiative from the others is the careful
  attention placed on the curriculum, especially in creating clear links between
  game-design and complex problem-solving tasks.
