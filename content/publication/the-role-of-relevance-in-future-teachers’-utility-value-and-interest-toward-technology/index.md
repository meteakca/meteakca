abstract: Seeing the relevance of tasks for future use is important for
  developing value and interest in them. We employed a pre- and post-test
  quasi-experimental design using a mixed-methods approach to examine if
  reflecting on the relevance of technology to future teaching practices
  influences elementary and secondary preservice teachers’ utility value and
  interest toward technology integration. The findings from 111 preservice
  teachers revealed that reflecting on the connections of technology to future
  teaching increased their maintained interest in technology integration
  regardless of their situational interest levels. Reflections also helped them
  recognize technology-supported classroom management strategies in their
  current implementations. Differences observed between elementary and secondary
  preservice teachers highlighted a need for helping secondary preservice
  teachers develop higher interest and deeper understanding of utility values of
  technologies for future practices. Results also underscored the importance of
  emphasizing various benefits of technology regarding collaboration,
  assessment, and self-paced learning—utility values that were minimally
  observed in the study.
