abstract: In Hampel and Hauck (2004) the basic second language learning theory
  is summa-rized as follows:“For language acquisition to take place, students
  must be provided with comprehensible input (Krashen, 1981, 1985), they have to
  be able to interact to negotiate leaning (Gass & Varonis, 1994; Varonis &
  Gass, 1985), and they must produce comprehensible output (Swain, 1985).” In
  accordance with this basic theory, most language instruction starts with a
  good amount of comprehensible input and with the advent of Communicative
  Language Teaching and other communicative types of teaching methodologies,
  students are forced to interact with either other learners or the teacher to
  negotiate meaning. However, while trying to find grounds for learners to
  communicate and produce comprehensible output, the lack of native speakers has
  always been seen as something which reduces the effectiveness of communication
  in that it was not authentic. For years, many institutions have hired native
  speakers–not necessarily ELT teachers–and made them responsible for speaking
  classes as the easiest way to solve this problem. The success of this approach
  can be discussed; however, the dependence upon such outer resources is losing
  its power in today’s world as new technologies enable us to communicate
  internationally without any charge and with good audio and even video quality.
  In this paper, one of these technologies, podcasting, is going to be touched
  upon and a web-site which enables even the most novice users to use this kind
  of high-tech technology is reviewed.
