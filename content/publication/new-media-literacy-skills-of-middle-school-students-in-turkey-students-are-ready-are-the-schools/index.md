abstract: In this descriptive research conducted on middle school students in
  Istanbul, Turkey, we report the results of two cross-sectional surveys which
  measured the New Media Literacy (NML) skills (Jenkins et al. 2006) and
  perceived technology abilities, and individual interviews regarding the
  content of computer classes and technology instruction. The results of the
  survey showed that the students were generally highly competent in the
  measured NML skills as well as using computers and the Internet. Through the
  interviews, however, students reported that the school computer classes taught
  only basic computer skills and procedures of productivity software, if not
  left free to play games. In the light of the findings, and previous research
  (Gungor & Akcaoglu 2010), in this paper, we report our initial findings and
  suggest how the computer classes can be modified to meet the demands of the
  changing world and the youth that has already caught up with, and in many
  respects, surpassed it.
