abstract: "Problem solving is an essential skill for students to be successful
  in life and careers. Students need to use efficient strategies to solve
  problems effectively. In this basic interpretive qualitative study, we aimed
  to (a) explore children’s problem-solving strategies in a game-based tool
  (i.e., puzzles), and (b) investigate the troubleshooting strategies they
  employed while solving the puzzles. We recorded students’ puzzle-solving
  efforts, and using an observation analysis approach, noted important moments,
  patterns in puzzle-solving, troubleshooting methods, and other noteworthy
  events. Our analysis showed that while solving computer-based puzzles,
  students demonstrated the use of three approaches: varying-one-thing-at-a-time
  (VOTAT), building all-at-once or change-all (CA), and a mixed approach. CA was
  the approach used most often, followed by VOTAT, and then the mixed approach.
  Of the two troubleshooting approaches, starting the sequence over was the
  preferred method. Others opted to search for the faulty tile in the sequence.
  We discuss how these findings can inform practice and provide some insights as
  to the usefulness of the game-based tool, Lightbot."
