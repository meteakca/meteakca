abstract: In this mixed-methods study, we examined if students benefitted from a
  game design course offered during an enrichment hour in terms of gains in
  their system analysis and design skills. Students at a rural middle school in
  Southeast US (n = 19) attended a 1-hour game design course offered weekly
  during an academic enrichment class period, for the duration of a school year,
  learning basics of digital game-design and practicing system design skills
  such as making flowcharts. The results of quasi-experimental data indicated
  that the treatment group’s pretest–posttest system analysis and design skills,
  compared to the control group, which did not receive any training, further
  improved, F(1,33) = 16.516, p < 0.001. Results from the interviews showed that
  the participants were able to verbalize how they applied system analysis and
  design skills developed during the course to problem-solving in different
  contexts. We discussed the instructional aspects of learning game-design that
  align with systems thinking. We also explored the possible influence of
  initial cognitive skills on student learning outcomes from such interventions.
