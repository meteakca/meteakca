abstract: "Games, and the game-design process, have received attention from
  researchers and educators due to their potential to serve as contexts to teach
  design and problem-solving skills for several reasons. First, games are
  inherently attractive for young children (Gee, 2003; Papastergiou, 2009;
  Prensky, 2003). The process of game-design, therefore, has a natural appeal,
  because the outcome of the process (i.e., the games) is meaningful and fun for
  the creators. This makes the process of game-design enjoyable and
  intrinsically motivating as the students get to work on things that they
  personally value. Designing learning environments to teach children digital
  game-design, while also aiming to teach thinking skills such as
  problem-solving, requires going through a rigorous process of instructional
  design, and integration of technology. The instructional design process
  requires bringing different variables together to work in harmony: theories,
  pedagogies, and technology (Mishra & Koehler, 2006). Integrating technology
  into teaching introduces an additional variable into the mix, and makes this
  process more complex (Koehler & Mishra, 2009). For this reason, in educational
  technology, “design” is front and center, requiring the process to be based on
  theory, grounded in data, and focused on problem-solving (Smith & Boling,
  2009). In this presentation, I will present information regarding the design
  and implementation of a technology-rich learning environment for middle-school
  students: Game-design and Learning courses (GDL). Since its inception in 2011,
  I have offered GDL courses to more than hundred students, including students
  from disadvantaged backgrounds. Through GDL curriculum, students learn, in an
  engaging way, the basics of digital game-design, programming, and more
  importantly complex problem solving. In my research, I have shown how the
  curriculum used at the GDL courses successfully reached these outcomes. In the
  current paper, I detail how such a technology-rich environment can be built,
  giving participants some concrete examples that they can take home and use,
  also some instructional design concepts that they can utilize while building
  their own."
