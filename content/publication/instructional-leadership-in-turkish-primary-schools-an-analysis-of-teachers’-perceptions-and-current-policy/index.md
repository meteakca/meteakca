abstract: School leadership, one of the most important aspects of school
  improvement, has not received much attention from either policymakers or
  researchers in Turkey despite many countries embrace creating and developing
  effective leaders as one of the important first steps to improve their
  education. This research looked at the instructional leadership skills of
  Turkish principals from the teacher's perspective measured through a survey
  collected from primary school teachers in five different cities in Turkey,
  first, to describe the current situation and, second, to find out if teachers’
  experience and gender affect their views. The results show that Turkish
  principals practice their instructional leadership roles only occasionally and
  teachers’ gender significantly affects their perception.
