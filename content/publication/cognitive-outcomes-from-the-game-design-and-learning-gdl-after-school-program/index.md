abstract: The Game-Design and Learning (GDL) initiative engages middle school
  students in the process of game-design in a variety of in-school,
  after-school, and summer camp settings. The goal of the GDL initiative is to
  leverage students' interests in games and design to foster their
  problem-solving and critical reasoning skills. The present study examines the
  effectiveness of an after-school version of the GDL program using a
  quasi-experimental design. Students enrolled in the GDL program were guided in
  the process of designing games aimed at solving problems. Compared to students
  in a control group who did not attend the program (n = 24), the children who
  attended the GDL program (n = 20) showed a significant increase in their
  problem-solving skills. The results provide empirical support for the
  hypothesis that participation in the GDL program leads to measurable cognitive
  changes in children's problem-solving skills. This study bears important
  implications for educators and theory.
