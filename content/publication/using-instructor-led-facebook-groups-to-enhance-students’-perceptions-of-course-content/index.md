abstract: Research on the impact of instructor-guided Facebook usage in college
  classrooms shows that the technology can increase students’ cognitive and
  affective learning, yet the role of social media in the classroom remains
  contentious. Analysis of open- and closed-ended survey data from 87 students
  enrolled in university courses from 15 institutions showed that students
  participating in a class Facebook group reported more interest in and
  perceived more value in course content, felt closer to the course and
  perceived their instructors as more involved. Effects on perceived closeness
  to course instructors and classmates were negligible, and effects on
  instructor immediacy or credibility were not found.
