abstract: The phenomenon of “digital divide” is complex and multidimensional,
  extending beyond issues of physical access. The purpose of this study was to
  develop a scale to measure a range of factors related to digital divide among
  higher education faculty and to evaluate its reliability and validity.
  Faculty’s Information and Communication Technology Access (FICTA) scale was
  tested and validated with 322 faculty teaching in public and private sector
  universities. Principal components analysis with varimax rotation confirmed an
  8-factor solution corresponding to various dimensions of ICT access. The
  57-item FICTA scale demonstrated good psychometric properties and offers
  researchers a tool to examine faculty’s access to ICT at four levels –
  motivational, physical, skills, and usage access.
