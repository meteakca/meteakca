abstract: This case deals with the problem of decision making in allocating
  resources during an educational game-development process. In educational
  games, unlike commercial games, there is an added focus on creating learning
  content, shifting the balance between learning and fun to a degree where
  essential game elements might be excluded from these games. In some cases,
  classroom settings, however, are filled with elements that can emulate the
  role of a missing element. As it was seen in this case, even when some
  important game elements (ie, narratives) were missing from a game, the
  presence of some important classroom elements (ie, teachers) helped replace
  them.
