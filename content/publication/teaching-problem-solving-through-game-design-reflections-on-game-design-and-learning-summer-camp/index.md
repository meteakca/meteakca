abstract: In this paper, we report the preliminary findings of the first Game
  Design and Learning Summer Camp, which was held in Istanbul, Turkey for the
  first time in the summer of 2011. Here we share the first insights we gained
  from the camp, as well as the design decisions we made while constructing our
  curriculum and activities. We also talk about our data collection process and
  sources, and our plans for future iterations.
