abstract: The purpose of this field experiment was to understand whether fifth
  and sixth-grade students were able to write about the usefulness and relevance
  of what they were learning in their science class through self-generated
  reflections and to examine the impacts of this activity on students’ value,
  utility value, and interest for science. Analysis of students’ essays revealed
  in the self-generated reflection condition students connected what they were
  learning to their lives significantly more than the control condition.
  Linguistically, student essays did not differ between the two conditions,
  except for cognitive processing. Self-reflecting increased students’ utility
  value but not value nor interest. Self-efficacy did not moderate these
  relations. Implications for extending self-generated utility value and broader
  social-psychological interventions for early adolescent students are
  discussed.
