abstract: Sociability is an environmental characteristic of online learning that
  is perceived to facilitate social interactions. Compared to face-to-face
  learning environments, online learning has been criticized for being “less”
  social. In an attempt to increase the sociability of online learning, this
  chapter reports two studies that were conducted to examine the impacts of (a)
  the size of discussion groups and (b) the use of supplementary social network
  sites in asynchronous online graduate courses. In the first study, the
  sociability of small group discussions versus whole class discussions was
  compared. The results indicated that when in small group discussions, students
  perceived a higher level of sociability, t (32)= 3.507, p< 0.001. In the
  second study, findings indicated that students who participated in a
  supplementary Facebook group, in addition to the regular academic activities
  in the learning management system, felt a higher level of sociability, t (32)=
  6.804, p< 0.001. Design decisions can influence social affordances in online
  learning, leading to an increase in students’ feelings of connectedness with
  others and instructors. The implications of the study include design
  guidelines for asynchronous, text-based discussions and the use of social
  network sites in online learning.
