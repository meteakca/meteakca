abstract: "Affinity spaces are digital or physical spaces in which participants
  interact with one another around content of shared interest. In education,
  some of the largest affinity spaces may be those organized around hashtags on
  Twitter: These spaces are public, largely unmoderated, and thriving, yet very
  little is known about them, especially those based in geographical areas, such
  as American states. This paper provides a novel and first large-scale study of
  Twitter-based affinity spaces through an examination of 47 State Educational
  Twitter Hashtags (SETHs). We collected over 580,000 tweets over the course of
  six months and examined them to determine who is participating in SETHs, how
  active participants are, and when participation occurred.. Looking across the
  results, we found support for considering SETHs as Twitter-based affinity
  spaces that merit further scholarly attention. We conclude with directions for
  future research on SETHs focused on participantsâ€™ individual characteristics,
  the structure of social networks, content of tweets, and differences between
  SETHs."
