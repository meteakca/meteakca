abstract: Twitter, a social media platform, has been embraced by educators as a
  way to form professional learning networks (PLN) to support student success
  (Coleman et al., 2018). Twitter offers just-in-time access to professional
  development, and the ability to share information and resources with
  colleagues all around the world (Carpenter & Krutka, 2014). State-level
  Twitter chats organized with labels called hashtags are thriving (Rosenberg et
  al, 2016) and are promising venues for educatorsâ€™ professional growth and
  educational research.
