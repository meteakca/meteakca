abstract: Social presence is a difficult to achieve, but an imperative component
  of online learning. In this study, we investigated the effect of group size on
  students' perceptions of social presence in two graduate-level online courses,
  comparing small group versus whole class discussions. Our results indicated
  that when in small group discussions, students perceived a higher level of
  social presence in terms of sociability, t (32)= 3.507, p=. 001; social space,
  t (29)= 3.074, p=. 005; and group cohesion, t (32)= 3.550, p=. 001. We discuss
  how placing students in small and permanent discussion groups can augment
  social presence. Designers and educators of online learning can strategically
  modify group size to promote social presence in asynchronous online
  discussions.
