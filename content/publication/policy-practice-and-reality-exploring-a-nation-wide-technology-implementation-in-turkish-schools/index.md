abstract: Technology has already become an indispensable part of our lives, and
  nations around the world see schools as the main agents to prepare their youth
  for a technology-filled future, and invest important amounts of funding to
  provide hardware to schools, students and teachers. The Turkish Ministry of
  National Education is in the midst of the FATİH project, a nation-wide attempt
  to provide each classroom with an interactive whiteboard and each student with
  a tablet computer. In this paper, the authors present interview data from
  teachers at first-year FATİH pilot schools who are using these technologies to
  understand how this national attempt is being translated into practice, and
  identify what is working and what areas need further attunement. Results show
  that teachers were especially content with being able to make their lessons
  visually more appealing for their students. They were, however, not satisfied
  with the in-service training provided, especially in understanding ways to
  effectively integrate the technologies into their teaching, and the
  limitations put upon Internet access from the tablets. The impacts of these
  tools on their teaching practices were very minimal.
