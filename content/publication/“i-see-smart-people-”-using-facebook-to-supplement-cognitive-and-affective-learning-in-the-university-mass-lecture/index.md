  Mass lecture courses are a mainstay in university instruction despite their
  limitations regarding student engagement and resultant learning outcomes.
  Out-of-class communications and learning management systems have been
  developed to address these limitations, but the former is resource-intensive
  and the latter is often viewed as an administrative rather than pedagogical
  aid. Facebook groups have proven to be useful and persistent spaces for
  connecting individuals around innumerable topics of interest. In this study, a
  course-specific Facebook group was created for an introductory mass media
  course at a large mid-Atlantic university to serve as a supplemental (and
  voluntary) space for course content discussions. End-of-the semester grades of
  the Facebook group users were significantly higher than the non-users, t(319)
  = 4.71, p < 001. In terms of affective learning, an analyses of the student
  responses indicated that students generally felt positively about being a part
  of the Facebook group. Thematic analysis of the Facebook posts indicated that
  students mainly used this space to discuss exam-related matters. We discuss
  potential reasons for this outcome, and implications of current research for
  future research and practice.
