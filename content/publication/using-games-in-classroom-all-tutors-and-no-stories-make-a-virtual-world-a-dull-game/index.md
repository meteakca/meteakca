abstract: This experimental study was conducted to determine the effectiveness
  of inclusion of a storyline, as initiated and progressed by episodic tasks,
  in, Zon, a language-teaching virtual world. Researchers tested two versions of
  the platform (with or without tasks) to a group of primary school students (n=
  19). The results showed there was no statistically significant difference
  between the no-story and story versions, t (18)= 1.120, p=. 277 in terms of
  liking, enjoyment and preference for future play. The unique design of the
  platform (the presence of tutors) is discussed as a potential explanation of
  the findings and suggestions as to using games in classroom is discussed.
