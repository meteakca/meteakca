abstract: Problem solving is perhaps the key characteristic that makes us human.
  Given the kinds of problems that we face in a competitive economy and society,
  the new generation of learners is ever more required to have problem-solving
  abilities. By drawing from the literature on technological pedagogical content
  knowledge, design thinking, general and specific methods of problem solving,
  and role of technologies for solving problems, this article highlights the
  importance of problem solving for future teachers and discusses strategies
  that can help them become good problem solvers and understand the requirements
  of teaching their students problem solving in technology-rich contexts. This
  article consists of two main parts. Part 1 focuses on strategies required to
  help preservice teachers to be better problem solvers, and Part 2 summarizes
  approaches to introduce preservice teachers to the methods of teaching problem
  solving. The strategies reviewed provide a tangible guidance for teacher
  education programs regarding how to promote future teachersâ€™ problem-solving
  skills.
