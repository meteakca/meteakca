abstract: "Digital divide centers on access to various dimensions of information
  and communication technology (ICT) including physical access, motivation,
  skills, and actual usage of digital technologies. This divide tends to be even
  wider in the context of developing countries. Yet, there is a lack of
  literature on the digital divide among the faculty who teach in higher
  education settings. Thus, as a preliminary effort, by using a 57-item
  Faculty’s ICT Access (FICTA) scale, we investigated the digital inequalities
  (at the physical, motivational, skills, and usage levels) among Pakistani
  faculty in respect of their personal and positional categories. We also
  examined the relationship between faculty’s instructional usage of ICT and
  other dimensions of their ICT access. The findings revealed that there were
  significant differences in the faculty’s access to technology at the four
  levels in respect of their personal and positional categories. Further, the
  findings of the study shed light on the theoretical implications of the
  framework of successive kinds of ICT access suggested by van Dijk (The
  deepening divide: inequality in the information society, 2005)."
