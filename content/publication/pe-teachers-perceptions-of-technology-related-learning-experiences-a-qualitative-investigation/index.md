abstract: "Background/Purpose: Educational organizations, such as National
  Association for Sport and Physical Education (NASPE) and International Society
  for Technology in Education (ISTE), established technology-related standards
  indicating the knowledge and skills necessary for teachers to integrate
  technology. Such standards have challenged teacher education programs to
  restructure existing PETE program to prepare teachers to have knowledge,
  skills, and dispositions necessary for successful technology integration
  (Jones, Bulger, & Wyant, 2012). Yet, physical education (PE) teachers
  frequently reported that they still do not feel sufficiently prepared to
  incorporate technology into their classroom (Juniu, Shonfeld, & Ganot, 2013).
  Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine in-service PE teachers' past
  learning experiences to integrate technology from three mediated learning
  situations and their perceptions of them. Methods/Analysis: Twelve PE
  teachers, who were enrolled in the Master's PETE program at a rural
  mid-Atlantic university were invited to participate in this current study
  based on the results of the Stage of Adoption of Technology (SAT) survey
  (Christensen, 1997). All participants completed an individual audio-recorded,
  structured interview regarding their past technology-related learning
  experiences in the three mediated learning situations. Inductive content
  analysis was used to examine the emergent themes (Elo & Kyngas, 2008).
  Trustworthiness of the data was established through member check, investigator
  triangulation, and peer debriefing. Results: With regard to technology-related
  learning experiences, the inductive content analysis revealed six learning
  sources: a) sport and exercise science coursework, b) discipline-specific
  pedagogy coursework, c) general teacher education coursework, d) school-wide
  technology workshops, e) discipline-specific technology workshops, f)
  discipline-specific technology coursework. Two overarching themes emerged from
  the interview data regarding participants' perceptions of those learning
  experiences: a) technology-centric/focused experience, and b) hands-on
  technology experience and observations. Conclusion: Since the level of
  teachers' knowledge and technology use are different, there should be various
  learning activities to address the different needs of teachers. The following
  technology integration training strategies would be appropriate: a) faculty
  education to model meaningful technology integration examples, b)
  self-exploration for deep understanding of technology, c) providing
  situation-based learning for extending learned knowledge, d) university
  collaboration with local K-12, and e) creating a learning community."
