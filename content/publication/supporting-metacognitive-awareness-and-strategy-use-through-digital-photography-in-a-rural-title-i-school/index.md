abstract: The Photography and Media Literacy Project (PMLP) was an after-school
  program designed to teach fourth and fifth grade children about the science
  and art of photography in a Title I school in rural southeast Georgia. Through
  the completion of a problem-based applied project, we endeavored to further
  enhance and develop students’ media literacy, critical thinking, and
  metacognitive skills. The project involved having students consider some
  aspect of their environment (ie, a problem from the natural, physical, school
  or social environment) and develop a media presentation about the topic (eg, a
  movie), which included images that they took (with iPods that we provided), as
  well as a narrative that described their observation, research, argument
  and/or experience. Through the use of technology and various other media, our
  purpose was to help these young learners improve their metacognitive planning
  and monitoring skills, as well as their problem-solving and reasoning ability,
  all foundational skills critical for success in high stakes assessments such
  as Georgia Milestone Assessment. Although no significant differences were
  found in pre-posttest assessments, we believe that with minor modifications,
  this type of program shows promise in its potential for boosting participants’
  metacognitive functioning and other skills related to critical evaluation of
  information, which have been found to enhance learning outcomes.
