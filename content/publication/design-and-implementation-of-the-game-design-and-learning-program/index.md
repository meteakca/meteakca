abstract: Design involves solving complex, ill-structured problems. Design tasks
  are consequently, appropriate contexts for children to exercise higher-order
  thinking and problem-solving skills. Although creating engaging and authentic
  design contexts for young children is difficult within the confines of
  traditional schooling, recently, game-design has emerged as an alternative
  context to provide young children with opportunities to practice design and
  thinking skills. Despite the increasing interest from educators and
  researchers to use game-design as a platform to teach young students
  higher-order thinking skills, literature documenting design and development of
  such learning experiences has been scarce. This paper provides a detailed
  account of how a complex network of pedagogies, theories, and technologies
  were brought together to design and develop the Game Design and Learning (GDL)
  program, with the purpose of teaching students basics of computer programming,
  and to give them hands-on experiences in game-design, and teach them complex
  problem-solving skills. The GDL program can serve as an example for efforts
  aiming to create similar technology-rich environments.
