abstract: The Zon Project is building a multi-user, game-based virtual
  environment to support learning Chinese language and culture. From its core,
  Zon is designed to be a multiplayer, online environment facilitating learning
  through gameplay. A goal of the project is to address issues hampering foreign
  language instruction, including the need for high quality feedback and
  participation in persistent environments. Being web-based, Zon provides
  real-time, on-demand connection to interactive learning activities and
  authentic cultural information. The game provides the opportunity for players
  to learn from non-player characters, responsive game agents, and other
  players.
