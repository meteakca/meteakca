abstract: In today‟s complex and fast-evolving world problem solving is an
  important skill to possess. For young children to be successful at their
  future careers they need to have the skill and the will to solve complex
  problems that are beyond the well-defined problems that they learn to solve at
  schools. One promising approach to teach complex problem solving skills is
  using visual programming and game design software. Theoretically and
  anecdotally, extant research enlightened us about the cognitive and
  motivational potential of these software. Due to lack of empirical evidence,
  however, we are far from knowing if these claims are warranted. In this
  quasi-experimental study, the cognitive (i.e., problem solving) and
  motivational (i.e., interest and value) impacts of participating at the Game
  Design and Learning Courses (GDL) on middle school children (n = 49), who
  designed games following a curriculum based on problem solving skills, were
  investigated. Compared to students in a control group (n =24), the results
  showed that students who attended the GDL courses showed significant gains in
  general and specific (i.e., system analysis and design, decision-making,
  troubleshooting) problem solving skills, (Wilks‟s Λ = .64), F (4, 68) = 9.564,
  p<.001. In this presentation, I report empirical outcomes, as well as detailed
  accounts of the design process for the GDL curriculum. Finally, I discuss
  implications of the GDL intervention for practice and theory
