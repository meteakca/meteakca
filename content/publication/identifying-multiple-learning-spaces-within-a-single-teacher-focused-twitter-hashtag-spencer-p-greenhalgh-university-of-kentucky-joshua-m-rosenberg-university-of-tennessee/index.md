abstract: The existing work on teacher-focused Twitter hashtags typically frames
  each hashtag as a single, unified phenomenon, thereby collapsing or erasing
  differences between them (and any resulting implications for learning). In
  this study, we conceived of teacher-focused hashtags as affinity spaces
  potentially containing subspaces distinguished by synchronous chats and other,
  asynchronous communication. We used computational methods to explore how
  participation differed in terms of content, interactions, and portals between
  these contexts within the# michED hashtag used by Michigan teachers. During
  the 2015-2016 academic year,# michED saw more non-chat activity than chat
  activity, and most participants only engaged in one mode of activity or the
  other. Participation during chats was associated with more replying as well as
  more socially-, affectively-, and cognitively-related content, suggesting a
  focus on social interaction. In contrast, non-chat participation was
  associated with more retweeting, mentioning, hyperlinks, and hashtags,
  suggesting a focus on content dissemination. These results suggest that
  different affinity spaces—and different literacy practices—may exist within
  the same hashtag to support different objectives. Teachers, teacher educators,
  and researchers should therefore be careful to make these distinctions when
  considering Twitter as a learning technology for teachers.
