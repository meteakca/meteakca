abstract: This paper describes a unit designed to promote the development of
  narrative writing skills among 5 th grade students through the use of LEGO
  robotics. Over the course of four, two and one-half hour sessions (one day per
  week for four consecutive weeks), the students learned how to construct and
  program robots, write and present a proposal to complete a mission, and
  connected the learning to their personal experiences with Hurricane Irma. The
  students began the activity with prior knowledge of World War II and
  Hiroshima. After learning the basics of building and programming robots, they
  were presented with a scenario similar to the impact of the bomb drop in
  Hiroshimaâ€“a city in ruins with survivors in need of supplies. Students took
  the role of engineers to work in pairs to create a proposal, which stated the
  problem and defined, and justified, a solution to pick up, and deliver,
  supplies through a specially-designed course using their robots. After the
  proposals were presented, and accepted, students programmed their robots
  according to their proposed solution; the activity required students to apply
  mathematical skills to measure distances in order to traverse parts of the
  course. Writing reflections were collected to determine individual student
  understanding and to include an additional element of writing. A final
  culminating activity required the students to write a narrative piece to
  relate the events of Hiroshima to their personal experiences with Hurricane
  Irma.
