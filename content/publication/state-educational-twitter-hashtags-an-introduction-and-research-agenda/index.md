abstract: Affinity spaces refer to digital and geographical spaces in which
  learning can happen, and some of the largest affinity spaces dedicated to
  education are those that currently exist on Twitter. These spaces are public,
  largely unmoderated, and thriving, yet very little is known about them. This
  paper seeks to shed some light on these basic questions about Twitter-based
  affinity spaces by presenting descriptive data about the participants and
  their patterns of activity across 47 State Educational Twitter Hashtags, or
  SETHs. We examine over 580,000 tweets collected over six months and identify
  who is participating and their degree of activity. We conclude with directions
  for future research on SETHs (or related affinity spaces on Twitter) focused
  on participantsâ€™ individual characteristics, the structure of the affinity
  space, and the content of tweets.
