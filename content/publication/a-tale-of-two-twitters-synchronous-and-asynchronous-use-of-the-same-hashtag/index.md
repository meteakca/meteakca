abstract: Communication in online settings can occur at the same time
  (synchronously) or at different times (asynchronously). A new form of online
  learning in which teachers communicate both at the same time and at different
  times is through social media platforms such as Twitter. In this descriptive,
  exploratory study, we set out to explore differences between synchronous and
  asynchronous interactions through a State Educational Twitter Hashtag (SETH)
  for educators in Michigan in the United States of America. We collected more
  than 8,000 tweets and coded for whether the tweet was during either part of a
  once-per-week synchronous “chat” or all other times of the week. We compared#
  miched between the two modes and then determined differences in terms of
  interactions and sentiment. Our analysis is discussed in light of findings
  from research on synchronous and asynchronous learning.
