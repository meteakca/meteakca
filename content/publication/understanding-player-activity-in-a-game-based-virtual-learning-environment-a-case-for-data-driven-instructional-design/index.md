abstract: When constructing game-based virtual learning environments, developers
  face considerations that differ from the concerns instructional designers
  raise for traditional learning scenarios. Absent are the physical world cues
  that teachers use to monitor guided learner actions. Without the sights and
  sounds of the real world, game developers rely on machine-aggregated server
  data and as such on impersonal feedback to interpret player actions and
  conclude latent learning activities. Embedding formative methods as vivid
  element of assessing and revising learning outcomes is considered as value
  added approach to enhance traditional learning analytics. Providing a holistic
  view of behavior in learning games by fostering the understanding of player
  activity also infers to instructional design issues. Merging insights from
  both perceptions opens the way to sustainable optimize learning games design.
  The study exemplifies the integration of data-driven methods by Zon, an MMORPG
  to learn Mandarin.
