abstract: Online education is often assumed to be synonymous with asynchronous
  instruction, existing apart from or supplementary to face-to-face instruction
  in traditional bricks-and-mortar classrooms. However, expanding access to
  computer- mediated communication technologies now make new models possible,
  including distance learners synchronous online attendance of face-to-face
  courses. Going beyond traditional uses of videoconferencing (e.g., real-time
  remote viewing with limited student interaction), this article describes the
  use of freely available technologies to support synchronous cooperative
  learning activities involving both face-to-face and hybrid doctoral students.
  Specifically, we describe the rationale behind pedagogical choices and specify
  how various technologies were re-purposed to create a virtual classroom space
  in which all possible combinations of face-to-face and hybrid students worked
  together in multiple small-groups across single class sessions. Implications
  for course development, the implementation of cooperative learning activities
  in online settings, and the use of both synchronous and asynchronous methods
  of online instruction are discussed.
