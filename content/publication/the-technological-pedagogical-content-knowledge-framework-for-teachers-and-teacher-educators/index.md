abstract: In this paper, we present Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge
  (TPACK) as a framework for the integration of technology within teaching.
  Three main bodies of knowledge–technological knowledge, content knowledge, and
  pedagogical knowledge–inform the design of this theoretical framework.
  Accordingly, we describe the characteristics of these three bodies of
  knowledge, along with the bodies of knowledge that emerge from the
  interactions between and among them. In this chapter, we argue that knowing
  how to integrate technology emerges from an understanding both of the three
  main bodies of knowledge and their interactions. We believe the TPACK
  framework has significant implications for teachers and teacher educators;
  specifically, we argue that teachers should be considered “designers” of
  curricula, and with regards to teacher educators, we identify “learning
  technology by design” and activity types as two key methods for the
  development of TPACK.
