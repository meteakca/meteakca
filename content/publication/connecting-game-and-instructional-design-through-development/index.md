abstract: The challenge when creating digital game-based learning applications
  is to simultaneously consider and satisfy theory and practice in the fields of
  both game and instructional design in order to construct successful learning
  games. A concern often raised about this process is that emphasis on game
  design will result in a lack of learning opportunities in the game and focus
  on instruction will produce a game that lacks fun and engagement. We believe
  finding the common elements in these design processes can begin to bridge this
  perceived gap between game and instructional design. To gain a shared
  understanding of methods and goals among project developers and construct a
  learning game that is enjoyable and educative, these processes should be
  connected within the context of development. In this paper, we discuss a
  current case study as a means towards understanding how game and instructional
  design can be connected through the development process.
