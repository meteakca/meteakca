abstract: Engagement in game design tasks can help preservice teachers develop
  pedagogical and technical skills for teaching and promoting critical thinking
  and problem-solving skills. Through the design process, preservice teachers
  not only exercise critical-thinking and problem-solving skills, but also learn
  about an instructional method to support their future students’
  problem-solving skills. Becoming comfortable with games and game design,
  however, requires firsthand design experiences, which teacher education
  programs hardly provide. Given the limited opportunities and research, this
  study attempted to gain insight into the implementation of a game design
  workshop to teach preservice teachers how to integrate game design in their
  future practices. In this exploratory case study, we analyzed reflections and
  lesson plans from four preservice teachers who participated in a game design
  workshop. Overall, the preservice teachers found the workshop to be effective
  in teaching them the intricacies of the game design process. However, both the
  participants’ learning experiences during the workshop and the level of
  pedagogical elements present in their lesson plans varied depending on their
  technology knowledge and teaching context.
