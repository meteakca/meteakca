abstract: Computational thinking is one of the skills critical for successfully
  solving problems posed in a technology driven and complex society. The limited
  opportunities in school settings to help students develop computational
  thinking skills underscores the need for helping teachers integrate it in
  their practices. Besides developing the knowledge of technology, content, and
  pedagogy, teachers need to recognize the relevance of computational thinking
  to their teaching, a factor influencing their future practice with it. Drawing
  from the literature on problem-solving and TPACK framework, this paper
  discusses strategies, including content-specific examples, problem-solving
  nature of computational thinking, and the methods of teaching problem-solving
  for enabling teachers to make the connections between computational thinking
  and their practices.
